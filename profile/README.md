## Hi there 👋


# Math Cognition UCSF

We are a team studying the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems, such as **mathematics** and **language**. Our research program aims at understanding how these systems develop and decline and how we can help.

We combine machine learning, computational modelling, electrophysiological recordings (intracranial EEG, MEG), neuroimaging (fMRI), continuous behavioral measures (trajectory-tracking) and neupsychology to study the processing stages and representational codes underlying cognitive operations. Complementarily, we use intracranial electrical stimulation to modulate brain activity and behavior.

We are part of UCSF Neurology (Memory and Aging Center) and Neurosurgery departments and we collaborate with several labs and innitiatives:
UCSF Dyslexia Center (UCSF)
Multitudes(UCSF)
ALBA Lab (UCSF)
Chang Lab (UCSF)
Computational and Language Lab (UC Berkeley) http://colala.berkeley.edu/

Our current projects are:

NeuroCausal 



Furthermore, we are active participants of initiatives to promote open, inclusive 
Gender bias in academia: A lifetime problem that needs solutions – 2021 - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.06.002). 

and reproducible science, such as the BrainHack community (see our recent perspective in Neuron: Brainhack: Developing a culture of open, inclusive, community-driven neuroscience – 2021 - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001). Because of the interdisciplinary nature of our research program, we have developed and improved methods to measure behavior and model brain activity, which are all open source and publicly available, notably: 

trajectory tracking (https://trajtracker.com/), 
a full iEEG preprocessing and analysis toolbox (https://github.com/pinheirochagas/lbcn_preproc),
methods for MEG multivariate decoding (https://github.com/pinheirochagas/Calc_MEG),
toolbox to convert iEEG data into the Neurodata Without Borders data standard (https://github.com/pinheirochagas/lbcn_nwb).
